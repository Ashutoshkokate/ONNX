# ONNX


### **1. Introduction to ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**

The **Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)** is an open-source format designed to streamline the interoperability of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models across different frameworks. Developed by **Microsoft** and **Facebook** in 2017, ONNX makes it possible for developers to use models across various environments and platforms without the need for retraining.

ONNX represents models in a **graph-based structure**, where **nodes** represent operations (such as convolutions or activations) and **edges** define the data flow between those operations. This consistency allows models to be easily transferred and deployed without compatibility concerns.

ONNX works with several leading ML frameworks, such as **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **scikit-learn**, and supports deployment across multiple hardware platforms like CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. It also fosters community contributions due to its open-source nature.

### **Understanding the Difference: ONNX vs. ONNX Runtime**

- **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** – Think of ONNX as a **universal blueprint** for machine learning models. It provides a standardized format that allows models trained in different frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) to be shared and used across various platforms. However, ONNX itself **does not execute** the model—it only defines how it should be structured.
    
- **ONNX Runtime** – This is the **execution engine** designed to run ONNX models efficiently. It optimizes performance by leveraging hardware acceleration (like GPUs and specialized processors) and provides faster inference across different environments. While ONNX defines the model, ONNX Runtime ensures that it runs efficiently on different hardware architectures.
    
In summary, ONNX is the **model format**, while ONNX Runtime is the **engine that runs the model efficiently**.

## 4. **Model Conversion to .ONNX for Cross-Framework Compatibility** : 

After covering the introduction, key features, installation process, and troubleshooting steps, it's important to include a section on model conversion. This process typically involves using pre-trained models from deep learning and machine learning frameworks. These models are often converted into the .onnx (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, which ensures compatibility across various frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others. Converting models to .onnx allows for easier deployment and scalability, enabling the use of the same model in different environments. Understanding this conversion process is essential for optimizing performance and leveraging the power of pre-trained models.

### **4.1 Converting a PyTorch Model to ONNX**

PyTorch makes it easy to convert a model to the ONNX format using the `torch.onnx.export()` function. Here's a step-by-step guide:

#### **Step Instructions:**

1. **Train or Load a PyTorch Model:** Ensure that you have a trained model in PyTorch. You can either train one from scratch or load a pre-trained model.
    
    Example:
    
    python
    
    ```
     import torch 
     import torchvision.models as models  
     Load a pre-trained ResNet model 
     model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True) 
     model.eval()
    ```


2. **Prepare the Dummy Input:** ONNX requires a dummy input to trace the model. This input should match the input shape expected by the model.
    
    Example (for a model accepting a 3x224x224 input):
    
    ```
   dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
    ```
    
3. **Convert the Model to ONNX:** Use the `torch.onnx.export()` function to convert the model.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
   torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "resnet18.onnx", export_params=True)
    ```

    


#### **Step Validations:**

- The model is successfully saved in the ONNX format as `resnet18.onnx`.

#### **Step Exceptions:**

- If the model export fails, check that the input tensor shape matches the model's input requirements and ensure all model layers are compatible with ONNX.

### **4.2 Converting a TensorFlow Model to ONNX**

For TensorFlow models, the easiest way to convert to ONNX is by using the `tf2onnx` converter.

#### **Step Instructions:**

1. **Install tf2onnx:** Install the `tf2onnx` package if not already installed.    
    ```
   pip install tf2onnx
    ```
    
2. **Load the TensorFlow Model:** You can use a pre-trained TensorFlow model or your own model.
    
    Example (using a pre-trained model):
    ```
     import tensorflow as tf 
     model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')`
    ```
3. **Convert the Model to ONNX:** Use the `tf2onnx.convert.from_keras()` function to convert the model.
    
    Example:
   ```
   # Define the input signature for the model.
	input_signature = [tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, 224, 224, 3], dtype=tf.float32)]
	
	# Convert the model to ONNX format 
	 
	onnx_model, _ = tf2onnx.convert.from_keras(model,input_signature=input_signature)

	 #Save the ONNX model using onnx.save

	onnx.save(onnx_model, "mobilenetv2.onnx")
	print('Tensor flow model convert into the ONNX')
   ```

#### **Step Validations:**

- Verify the model is successfully saved as `mobilenetv2.onnx`.

#### **Step Exceptions:**

- If the conversion fails, check for compatibility issues between TensorFlow version and tf2onnx.
- Some TensorFlow models might require specific preprocessing steps before converting.


For other model conversions to ONNX format, refer to the GitHub repository [ONNX Tutorials](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials). It provides comprehensive guides, examples, and best practices for converting models from frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more into ONNX. The repository also covers advanced features such as optimization, quantization, and runtime integration, making it an essential resource for seamless model deployment across platforms. By exploring these tutorials, you can efficiently handle conversions for various frameworks and resolve potential compatibility challenges specific to your models.


### Accuracy Comparison: PyTorch vs ONNX Converted Model

In this section, we compare the accuracy of a ResNet18 model trained using PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset and its corresponding ONNX conversion. Our aim is to check whether the accuracy of the model remains almost the same after converting it to the ONNX format.

### Approach:

1. **Training the PyTorch Model**:  
    We trained a ResNet18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, incorporating data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance. The last layer of the model was modified to output predictions for 10 classes instead of the original setup.
    
2. **Converting the Model to ONNX**:  
    After training the model in PyTorch, we exported it to the ONNX format using PyTorch's built-in export function.
    
3. **Evaluating Accuracy**:  
    Both the trained PyTorch model and the converted ONNX model were tested on the CIFAR-10 test set to evaluate their accuracy. The accuracy of both models was then compared to ensure consistency.
    

### Code Details:

- **Training the PyTorch Model**:  
    The full code for training the PyTorch model can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EbVnIvWZL5_Wiro41WkGX8r22GoaBWNA?usp=sharing).
    
- **Exporting the Model to ONNX**:  
    The code to export the trained model to ONNX format and evaluate it can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EbVnIvWZL5_Wiro41WkGX8r22GoaBWNA?usp=sharing).

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Train the PyTorch model**: Start by training the ResNet18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and check its accuracy on the test set.
    
2. **Export the model to ONNX**: Once the PyTorch model is trained, use the export function to convert it into the ONNX format.
    
3. **Evaluate the ONNX model**: After converting, evaluate the accuracy of the ONNX model on the CIFAR-10 test set.
    
4. **Compare the results**: Finally, compare the accuracy of both the PyTorch and ONNX models to ensure they are almost identical.
    
### What You Should Expect:

- **Expected outcome**: The accuracy of the PyTorch and ONNX models should be very close to each other. If they are significantly different, check for issues in the model conversion or the evaluation process.

### Possible Issues:

- If there is a noticeable difference in accuracy, verify that the conversion from PyTorch to ONNX was done correctly and that the ONNX model is working as expected.


### **ONNX Optimizer**

The **ONNX Optimizer** is a tool designed to improve the performance of models in the ONNX format. It helps reduce the size of models, speeds up their inference (how fast the model makes predictions), and enhances efficiency when deploying on different devices, such as mobile phones or edge devices.

### **Key Features of ONNX Optimizer**

1. **Smaller Model Size**: It removes unnecessary parts of the model to make it smaller, which is useful when storage space is limited.
    
2. **Faster Inference**: The optimizer helps the model run faster, reducing delays when making predictions.
    
3. **Efficient Hardware Use**: Optimizations can make the most out of hardware like GPUs, mobile processors, or edge devices, helping them run your model more efficiently.
    
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: It ensures that the model can run well on different platforms, from cloud services to mobile or edge devices.
    
### **How to Use ONNX Optimizer**

1. **Installation**
    
    First, install the ONNX Optimizer with the following command:
    ```
    pip install onnxoptimizer
    ```
2. **Optimizing a Model**
    
    Once installed, you can load your model and apply optimizations like this:
    ```
	import onnx import onnxoptimizer  
	# Load your model 
	model = onnx.load('your_model.onnx') 
	# Optimize the model
	optimized_model = onnxoptimizer.optimize(model)  
	# Save the optimized model 
	onnx.save(optimized_model, 'optimized_model.onnx')
    ```
3. **Selecting Specific Optimizations**
    
    You can choose specific optimizations if you only want certain types, like removing identity operations or fusing transposes:
    ```
     passes = ['eliminate_identity', 'fuse_consecutive_transposes'] 
     optimized_model = onnxoptimizer.optimize(model, passes)`
    ```

ONNX Optimizer is a valuable tool for improving the efficiency of models in the ONNX format. It helps reduce the model size, speeds up predictions, and makes sure the model works efficiently across various devices. Just be sure to test your optimized model to ensure it still performs as expected, especially in terms of accuracy.
